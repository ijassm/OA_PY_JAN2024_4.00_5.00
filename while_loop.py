# 1. Write a C program to print all natural numbers from 1 to n. – using while loop

# n = int(input("Enter the n number: "))
# i = 0

# while i < n:
#     i += 1
#     print(i)

# 2.Write a C program to print all natural numbers in reverse (from n to 1). – using while loop

# n = int(input("Enter the n number: "))
# i = 1

# while n >= i:
#     print(n)
#     n -= 1

# 3.Write a C program to print all alphabets from a to z. – using while loop

# start = 97
# stop = 122

# # print(chr(97))

# while start != stop + 1:
#     print(chr(start))
#     start += 1

# 4.Write a C program to print all even numbers between 1 to 100. – using while loop

# i = 0
# stop = 100

# while i < stop:
#     i += 2
#     print(i)

# 5.Write a C program to print all odd number between 1 to 100.

# i = 1
# stop = 100

# while i < stop:
#     print(i)
#     i += 2

# 6. Write a C program to find sum of all natural numbers between 1 to n.

# i = 0
# sum = 0
# n = 10

# while i < n:
#     i += 1
#     sum += i

# print("sum =", sum)

# 7. Write a C program to find sum of all even numbers between 1 to n.

# i = 0
# evenSum = 0
# n = 10

# while i < n:
#     i += 2
#     evenSum += i
#     print("even num =", i)

# print("Total =", evenSum)
